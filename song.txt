The blade I swing is black as night
Black as my soulless heart
It bears the burden of many lives
But I don’t feel remorse
I lent my sword to anyone
Willing to pay the price
No regrets for what I’ve done
A mercenary’s life
But there I was, on Battleground
Until I felt the jaws of death
Cut into my flesh
Defending old and weak
But I did not retreat
